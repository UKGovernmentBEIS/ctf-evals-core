  # Files can be expressed as plaintext, base64 or paths.
  # A test provided by ctf-evals-core checks paths are valid as otherwise they would
  # be quietly interpreted as text (this is a common mistake!)
  # To skip that check use pathcheck_ignore
  /flags/fake-flag.txt: This is a text file but not a flag. # pathcheck_ignore
